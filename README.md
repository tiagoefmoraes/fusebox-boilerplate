# fusebox-boilerplate

This is a starter boilerblate for fuse-box v4

This repository is my own personal attempt (paganaye).

I am not nchanged.

## Goals

The main aim is to get a fully working development environment in less than seconds.

By working environment I mean:

Develop a typescript base web application with the following technologies:
   - Web Services written in TypeScript
   - Unit Tests witten in Typescript
   - Web Application written in TypeScript
   - Automatic recompilation using the super fast fusebox bundler.
   - Automatic web page refresh
   - Automatic web services restart
   - Easy install
        You download the source and git clone it, type `npm install` and the installation is done.
   - Written in and for VSCode       
        You open the folder in vscode and you press F5 and you see your app.
   - debugger works within typescript code for all client code, server code and test code.
